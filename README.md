Key findings: 
  - Annual members take more rides during weekdays in comparison to Casual riders, Casual riders tend to have more rides on the Weekends
  - There is a very high demand from Casual riders in the summer, Casual riders use Cyclestic services, especially during the holidays.
  - Annual members also have a higher amount of rides in the summer, but not as Casual riders, Annual members tend to use Cyclestic throughout the year at      a steady pace.
  - Annual members tend to have more rides with a shorter ride duration
  - Casual riders tend to have fewer rides with a longer ride duration
  - There is a very low amount of rides for both of the subscription groups in January and February, 
    which may be caused by weather conditions and heavy snow.
  - Casual riders mostly take rides to visit vacation and entertainment sites, on the contrary to annual members.
    ⇒ Annual members tend to use Cycletsic bikes as a transportation tool to commute to work
    ⇒ Casual riders tend to use Cyclestic bikes to visit tourist attractions and attend conferences during the holidays

Recommendations:
  - After noticing that most Casual riders use Cyclestic in the summer, the company can create suitable plans for them instead of the Annual plan, 
    for example:
    => Create a 3-month plan
  - Provide discounts and free tickets for the tourist attraction sites in Chicago for :
  - Riders subscribed to the plan after they reach a certain amount of minutes in trip duration
  - Increase the advertising in the most visited places by Casual riders
  - Make the Annual membership and other plans more affordable than being a casual rider (Make the average cost of rides more expensive for casual riders)
  - Riders who invite others to subscribe to the Annual plan (for example five people) will have a discount on their Annual plan.
  - Provide more bike types for Annual members
